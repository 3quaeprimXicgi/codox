## What is Showdown?
  
Showdown is a 48-page book that expands on the material in the first book in the series, Legends of the Old West. It includes errata for the other three books in the series, new gangs, new gunfighters, tips on running a campaign, new campaign rules, new items to buy, new skills, and a slew of alternative settings for different historical periods and locations[^1^] [^2^].
  
The book is designed by Mark Latham and based on the Strategy Battle Game system by Rick Priestley. It features cover art by Jon Hodgson and Pete Borlace, and illustrations and graphics by Jon Hodgson, Mark Latham, and Pete Borlace. The book also contains plenty of 25mm miniatures photos from various suppliers such as Old Glory, Artizan Designs, Foundry, Conquest Miniatures, Dixon, Brigade Games, Perry Miniatures, North Star, Redoubt Miniatures, Copplestone Castings, Westwind Productions[^2^].
  
## What are the new rules?
  
Showdown introduces some new rules to enhance your gaming experience. For example, there is a new section on The Weapons Locker that gives you more options for firearms and melee weapons. You can choose from different types of pistols, rifles, shotguns, bows, knives, tomahawks, swords, and more. Each weapon has its own characteristics such as range, strength, reload time, special rules[^2^].
  
Another new feature is the Gatherin' the Posse section that allows you to create your own custom gangs using a points system. You can choose from different types of characters such as leaders, heroes, henchmen, specialists, and hired guns. Each character has a points value based on their skills and equipment. You can also choose from different nationalities such as American, British, French, German, Mexican[^2^].
  
Showdown also adds some new skills to the game such as Ambush, Brawler, Cavalryman, Crack Shot, Duelist, Fast Draw, Gambler, Gunsmith, Horse Thief, Indian Fighter, Lawman, Lucky, Medic, Outlaw, Quick Load, Rancher, Scout, Sharpshooter, Sneaky, Tracker[^2^].

One of the most exciting additions is the Special Equipment Rules section that gives you access to some rare and exotic items that can give you an edge in combat or in other situations. For example, you can buy an Improved Scope that increases your shooting range by 6", or a Landanum that reduces your wound penalties by 1 for one game turn. However, these items come with a price: they are expensive and hard to find[^2^].
  
## What are the new scenarios?
  
Showdown provides three new scenarios that you can play with your gangs: Hero of the Day, Defend the Village, and Train Robbery. Each scenario has its own objectives, special rules and victory conditions[^2^].

In Hero of the Day you have to rescue a hostage from a band of outlaws before they escape or kill him. In Defend the Village you have to protect a small settlement from an attack by raiders or Indians. In Train Robbery you have to rob a train full of valuables while avoiding the guards and passengers[^2^].
  
## What are the new campaigns?
  
Showdown also offers some new campaign rules that allow you to create your own stories and adventures with your gangs. You can use the Warhammer Historical Example Campaign as a guide or create your own using the Unexpected Events Rules that generate random events that affect your gang's progress[^2^].

Some of the unexpected events include: Ambush where your gang is attacked by enemies on the road; Bounty where someone puts a price on your leader's head; Disease where
